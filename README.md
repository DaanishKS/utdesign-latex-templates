# UTDesign LaTeX Templates

This repository contains LaTeX templates to be used for UTDesign Senior Capstone Project deliverables.

As of this writing, templates for meeting agendas and minutes have been uploaded.

## LaTeX and Overleaf

In my experience, LaTeX is the best tool to rapidly develop deliverables such as agendas, templates, reports, presentations, etc. with consistent formatting and structure. It takes a little while to learn the syntax, but in the long-term, it will save you *a lot* of headaches and is *much better* than MS Word or Google Docs (for this particular use case).

The easiest way to get started with these templates is to use [Overleaf][1], a popular online LaTeX editor. Projects on Overleaf can be shared with collaborators to allow for real-time remote editing, much like Google Docs.

To try it out, you can immediately open up these templates in Overleaf by clicking this [link][2]. (You will need to register a free account beforehand.)
